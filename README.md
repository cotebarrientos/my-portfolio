## Deployment

### Clone Project from GitHub

**1.** Follow this link to the [Project GitHub repository](https://github.com/cotebarrientos/my-portfolio).

**2.** Scroll to the top of this repository and click on the "clone or download button".

**3.** Decide whether you want to clone the project using HTTPS or an SSH key and do the following:

- **HTTPS:** click on the checklist icon to the right of the URL.
- **SSH key:** first click on 'Use SSH' then click on the same icon as above.

**4.** Open the 'Terminal'.

**5.** Choose the location for the cloned directory.

**6.** Type `git clone`, and then paste the clone URL.

    $ git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name

**7.** Press 'Enter' to create your local clone.

### Local Deployment

**1.** After cloning this project, navigate to the correct file location after unpacking the files.

    $ cd <path to folder>

**2.** Now type this command in the console in order to install all the libraries used in this project.

    $ npm install

**3.** Then run the following command in the terminal, in order to run this project locally.

    $ npm start


**4.** After that, this React project should be running on `http://localhost:3000/`

### Deployment using GitHub Pages

**1.** Install the `gh-pages` package using the following command:

    $ npm install gh-pages â€” save-dev

**2.** Add homepage property to `package.json` file as follow:

    {
        "homepage": "https://username.github.io/repository-name/",
        "name": "project_name",
        "version": "0.1.0",
        "private": true,
        "dependencies": {...},
        "scripts": {...},
        "eslintConfig": {...},
        "browserslist": {...},
        "devDependencies": {
            "gh-pages": "^3.2.3"
        }
    }

**3.** Write the *"predeploy"* and *"deploy"* scripts under `package.json` file as follow:

    "scripts": {
        "predeploy": "npm run build",
        "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
        "start": "react-scripts start",
        "build": "react-scripts build",
        "test": "react-scripts test",
        "eject": "react-scripts eject"
    }

**4.** Save `package.json`, and run the following command to deploy it to GitHub Pages

    $ npm run deploy

**5.** Now if you switch to your GitHub repository and then Settings -> GitHub pages section you will be able to see the URL that you assigned to the homepage property in your `package.json`.
